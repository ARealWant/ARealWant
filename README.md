- I don't often have the chance to post my projects online because a lot of them aren't open source. But when I do work with a team, I like to share what we've been working on. Sharing knowledge and experiences can be really valuable, especially in the tech field.
- Over the past few years, I have worked on a number of projects. One of the most successful so far has been the Tempy Discord bot. It has received a lot of positive feedback and has proven to be a valuable asset to many users.
- I'm very passionate about politics and love engaging in discussions about current events. In my free time, I enjoy participating in physical activities such as swimming and cycling. I also love connecting with new people and hearing about their diverse perspectives on a variety of topics.
- Although I have a fair amount of experience with various programming languages, I still struggle with writing error-free code. Despite this, I enjoy helping others, particularly those who are new to programming, and try to encourage them to improve their skills. I believe that with dedication and practice, anyone can become proficient in coding.
